Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/fitnessGWAS/tree/c386787073d6bc80f7be30ea346adfbae7746636" target="_blank">c386787</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Run enrichment tests</h2>
<p>The following uses custom code stored in <code>code/GO_and_KEGG_gsea.R</code>, which in turn relies on the <code>fgsea</code> package. This test involves ranking genes by some statistic (e.g. the ) and then searching for GO and KEGG terms that are over-represented among genes at the top or bottom of the list.</p>
<p>Here, we first calculate the average for each of the mixture assignment probabilities (i.e. equal effects, sexual anatagonism, female-limited, and male limited) for all the loci mapping to each gene, to obtain gene-level measures. The reults are then used for GO and KEGG enrichment tests using <code>fgsea</code>. The output of <code>fgsea</code> includes the “normalised enrichment score” (NES), which describes how much the pathway is over-represented at the top of this list (for positive NES), or over-represented at the bottom (negative NES), and there is an associated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value for each NES (calculated by resampling).</p>
<p>In the tables below, one can click ‘column visibility’ then either ‘leadingEdge’ or ‘genes’ to see a list of genes that were annotated with the focal GO or KEGG term and also scored highly for the focal gene-level metric.</p>
