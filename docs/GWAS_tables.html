Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/fitnessGWAS/tree/af15dd63a476b2499f2be7f3002df3ec72c28522" target="_blank">af15dd6</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Table of significant groups of linked variants</h2>
<p>This table shows loci (i.e. groups of linked variants) that passed the arbitrary statistical significance threshold of <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 10^{-5}\)</span> for one or more of the four phenotypes (in a linear mixed model GWAS implemented in GEMMA). The significant loci (and groups of loci surrounding the significant one) were identified using the SNP clumping method of PLINK; each group of loci contains at least one variant that met the significance threshold, plus other loci that are within 250kb of the most significant locus, plus in linkage disequilibrium with it with r-squared &gt; 0.5 (see the <a href="http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/clump.shtml">PLINK documentation</a>). The third and fourth columns identify the gene(s) whose exons and introns overlap the focal locus. Columns 6-9 show the estimated effect size of the index variant on the four phenotypes (corrected by <code>mashr</code> using the data-driven method), while the final columns show the mixture proportions estimated by <code>mashr</code> using the canonical method.</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
