Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/fitnessGWAS/tree/c386787073d6bc80f7be30ea346adfbae7746636" target="_blank">c386787</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Table showing the significant transcripts</h2>
<p>The table shows the 784 transcripts that were significant in one or more ways (shown in the ‘significance’ column), e.g. transcripts whose abundance showed a sexually antagonistic relationship with fitness in the early-life assays are denoted <code>SA_early</code>. Columns 4-7 show the <code>mashr</code>-adjusted regression coefficients that relate the line mean transcript abundance to the line mean fitnesses. Columns 8-9 show the male bias in expression, and the average expression level, of the focal transcript. The last five columns give the mixture assignment probabilities from <code>mashr</code>. Abbreviations: AC = age concordant, SC = sexually concordant, SA = sexually antagonistic.</p>
