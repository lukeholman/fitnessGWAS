Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/lukeholman/fitnessGWAS/tree/a232dfee21acbf7c0f706a7a4873a82b108c02c9" target="_blank">a232dfe</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Table showing significant transcripts from the TWAS</h2>
<p>The table shows the 517 transcripts that were associated with one or more of the four phenotypes, with a p-value less than 0.01. The sex difference in expression (column 4) and the average expression level (across both sexes; column 5) were calculated from the DGRP expression data from Huang et al. 2015 (<em>PNAS</em>). Columns 6-9 show the regression coefficients that relate the line mean transcript abundance to the line mean fitnesses (with positive and negative values highlighted in colour), while columns 10-13 give the associated <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values.</p>

<h3>Table showing the numbers of transcripts related to fitness</h3>
<p>The table tallies up the numbers of transcripts showing a particular significant relationship with fitness (rows) for various different <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value thresholds (columns). For example, ‘Female early only’ counts the number of transcripts whose expression significantly correlated with mean female early life fitness across lines. ‘Age concordant, males’ counts transcripts whose expression correlated with early- and late-life fitness in males, in the same direction, while ‘Age antagonistic, males’ counts transcripts showing a significant, opposite relationships with male early- and male late-life fitness. Similarly, ‘Sex concordant, early’ counts transcripts showing a concordant effect on early life fitness in both males and females, and ‘Sex antagonistic, late’ counts those showing opposing effects on late-life fitness in males and females. The categories are all mutually exclusive, such that transcripts are only counted towards the most specific category that applies to them. Note that this method has low power to detect transcripts that correlate with two or more fitness metrics, because there are two or more opportunities to make a ‘false negative’ error, and the power is low for any given transcripts (this is why we use a range of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values, including some low ones).</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
