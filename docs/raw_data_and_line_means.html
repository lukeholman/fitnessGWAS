The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<p>To facilitate data re-use, we here provide tables showing the raw
data (i.e. the measurements of male and female fitness that were
collected on each individual replicate vial), as well as the estimated
line means that were calculated in <a
href="get_predicted_line_means.html">this script</a>.</p>

<h3>Female fitness</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>Vial</code> is a unique ID for each vial, which groups
together observations of the same group of 5 DGRP females whose fitness
was measured.</li>
<li><code>Block</code> is the experimental block in which fitness was
measured.</li>
<li><code>Line</code> gives the DGRP line number of the focal
females.</li>
<li><code>Female fitness early</code> gives the number of L1 larvae
produced by the DGRP females, in the early-life measurement.</li>
<li><code>Female fitness late</code> gives the number of L1 larvae
produced by the DGRP females, in the late-life measurement.</li>

<h2>Estimated line means</h2>
<p>The four columns other than <code>Line</code> give the line mean
fitness for each of the four fitness traits. Fitness was estimated from
Bayesian multivariate Poisson or Binomial models described in <a
href="get_predicted_line_means.html">this script</a>. The fitness values
were expressed on the scale of the linear predictor (and thus are
approximately normally distributed), and have been scaled to have a mean
of zero and variance of one. Thus, a line with mean fitness equal to 1.5
is 1.5 standard deviations above average, on the scale of the linear
predictor. Note that male fitness was not measured in
<code>line_354</code> due to experimenter error.</p>
